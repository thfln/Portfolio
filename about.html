        <h3>üåø Beyond the Code</h3>
        <p>
          In my free time (when it's afforded to me), I enjoy playing in a recreational soccer league, hiking, and weightlifting. I'm passionate about linguistics and bioengineering, and deeply curious about everything from amateur astronomy to ancient civilizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also a dedicated parent and lifelong learner. I spend weekends spending time with my kids and experiementing with plant-based recipies. I'm fluent in both English and Spanish, currently learning Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, and Finnish, and often use language as a way to better understand culture and communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite creative outlets include music performance and live streaming that incorporates community interaction and improv for uniquely engaging experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the central tenents of my personal philosophy is being of service to others. I strive to be empathetic, helpful, and empowering in every space I enter from mentoring junior analysts to demystifying AI for clinical teams.
        </p>

        <h3>üéâ Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I once built a predictive model to determine which KDrama would make my partner cry first.</li>
          <li>My strongest deadlift happened at a data science conference.</li>
          <li>I'm a vegetarian and make a mean plant-based stir fry.</li>
          <li>I regularly study 5+ languages and find parallels between linguistic structure and data modeling.</li>
          <li>I'm building a faily unexplored framework to detect cogitive load in soccer players using biometrics to combine neuroscience, sports, and ML.</li>
        </ul>
